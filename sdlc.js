// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/
// 1st: Planning
// 2nd: Analysis of Requirements
// 3rd: Design
// 4th: Implementation
// 5th: Testing & Integration
// 6th: Maintain





//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = 
"This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added.";

const analysisOfRequirements = 
"the process of determining user expectations for a new or modified product. These features, called requirements, must be quantifiable, relevant and detailed.";

const Design = 
"the design phase is a stage where software developers define the technical details of the product. Depending on the project, these details can include screen designs, databases, sketches, system interfaces, and prototypes.";

const Implementation = 
"The project takes shape during the implementation phase. This phase involves the construction of the actual project result. Programmers are occupied with encoding, designers are involved in developing graphic material, contractors are building, the actual reorganisation takes place.";

const testingAndIntegration = 
"ntegration Testing is a web development terminology used to test the software modules. Software is subdivided into multiple modules that different web developers code. These web developers vary in expertise, experience, and subject specialization.";

const maintain = 
"Maintaining a website is the most crucial phase of its life cycle. Regular revamps are necessary for sustaining a competitive edge. Applications and contents need to be regularly updated. Constant grooming is required for keeping the website “live”.";
